Narrative Walk-through 
Opening the App
The user opens Scribex to a clean, welcoming homepage that acts as a dashboard. It displays an overview of the user’s writing projects, including completion percentages, exercise progress, and current XP/level. This screen provides access to all main sections of the app via a bottom or side navigation bar.
The icons lead to:
Open World Writing (a page icon): long-form student-driven projects


Exercises (a quill or checkmark icon): AI-generated writing challenges


Dashboard (home icon): overview of progress across projects


Profile (user icon): personal stats and customization


Social / Leaderboard (group/trophy icon): peer interaction and editing feedback


The visual tone is sleek and minimal, intentionally distraction-free to keep writing at the center. Students can browse their current projects or begin something new.
Starting or Resuming a Project
The user clicks "New Project" or resumes an existing one. They’re prompted to choose a genre (e.g., persuasive essay, narrative, creative writing), which activates certain genre-based feedback schemas later used by the AI.
Each project has two key components:
Open World Writing


Exercises, which are generated from the student's writing
Projects can be accessed from the dashboard or via direct links within the Exercises section.
Open World Writing Mode
This is the creative, open-ended writing space where students do their work. When writing, the following things happen:

The document auto-saves regularly.


As the student types, AI feedback is live, flagging potential issues in grammar, flow, and clarity. These flags are highlighted inline—similar to how Google Docs suggests edits—but instead of proposing rewrites, the AI prompts with questions.
Examples:
“This sentence is unclear. What could you do with the verb to make the action more direct?”
“The tone in this paragraph feels different from the rest. Why do you think that is?”


This feedback can be temporarily hidden via a toggle at the top of the page, allowing students to focus and re-engage with the editor once they reach a stopping point.
Positive reinforcement is also baked into this mode. The AI occasionally highlights well-structured sentences with praise like:
“Great example of parallel structure here.”


“This transition works smoothly—nice job!”
These comments are brief and designed to encourage without disrupting flow.
Entering Editor Mode
At any time, the student can toggle Editor Mode. This activates a panel or overlay that shows all the exercises generated from their most recent writing session.
There may be, for example, 12 exercises based on a 3-paragraph draft. These exercises are tied directly to issues the AI flagged and are categorized by the Three Layers:
Mechanics (e.g., punctuation, sentence structure)
Sequence (e.g., logical consistency, flow)
Voice (e.g., audience awareness, rhythm, rhetorical power)


 Completing Exercises
Each exercise is interactive and designed to promote metacognitive reflection. Instead of doing the work for the student, the system asks them to think like editors.
Examples:
Multiple-choice comma placement tasks


Rewrite this sentence until your “clarity score” improves


Add a sentence to improve paragraph transitions


Each exercise yields a score—either a percentage (for objective tasks) or a clarity/voice rating for subjective work. Students must achieve 90%+ overall on these tasks to unlock publishing.
Exercises may be retried, and the app encourages iteration. A user who fails a clarity challenge, for example, is invited to reword the sentence and try again until they succeed.
Publishing Work
Once exercises are passed, the student unlocks the ability to publish their draft to a Bubble (a small social group—classroom-based, genre-based, or invite-only).
The published version is locked and saved permanently to represent a point-in-time achievement.


Students can continue editing to create newer drafts. If meaningful revision is made (e.g., >25% change or new exercise set complete), they may re-publish an updated version.


If a project is deleted entirely, all its drafts are deleted. But individual published versions cannot be removed, encouraging respect for past growth.


Social Bubbles and Peer Feedback
After publishing, the student's draft becomes visible to others in their Bubble. Users can:
Leave comments (anonymously or not, depending on Bubble settings)


Complete editing exercises on each other’s drafts


Earn XP for thoughtful feedback


Bubbles are limited in size and can be:
Classroom Bubbles (auto-assigned via a school code; managed by Guides)


Public Bubbles (open, discoverable; only adults may join)


Private Bubbles (join-by-code)


Users can be in multiple bubbles at once (except for student users, who are limited to their classroom). Guides can moderate, set rules (e.g., disable anonymous comments), and track all student engagement.
XP System and Progression
Scribex uses an XP-based level system to reward:
Writing new material


Completing exercises


Editing one’s own drafts


Giving feedback to others
XP is exponential, meaning each level takes more effort than the last. As users level up, they unlock:
New genres/templates


More creative autonomy


Less intervention from the AI (i.e., fewer hand-holding prompts)


The ability to create and manage Bubbles (for adult users)
This structure mirrors a game-like environment and is especially motivating for younger users without compromising learning depth.
Profiles and Customization
Each user has a Profile page that displays:
Their level and XP progress


Their active and completed projects


Draft version trees (unpublished versions only)


Bubble memberships


Students have limited customization (maybe a few color themes). Adult users may have expanded options.
Privacy and Safety Features
Students can’t join public or private Bubbles—only classroom ones.


Anonymous commenting is visible to Guides for moderation purposes.


No DMs, no free chat features.


No AI-generated content. The AI only prompts, highlights, and scores.


Version history is saved only for in-progress drafts (not published versions).


All data is cloud-saved and compliant with privacy standards (COPPA, FERPA-ready).

Scribex: Write the Future Well
Developer Specification Document
 Version: MVP Spec | Platform: Web-first | Date: June 2025

1. Product Philosophy
Scribex is a writing education platform that re-centers writing as an iterative, recursive, and self-guided process. Inspired by Flower & Hayes' cognitive process model and long-term memory cue research, Scribex emphasizes:
Iteration & Self-Editing: Feedback is formative, not prescriptive. Students improve through editing their own and others’ writing, not through static drills.


Cued Recall Learning: Exercises are drawn from the student’s own writing, triggering stronger memory activation than isolated tasks.


Recursive Writing: There are no artificial silos between brainstorming, drafting, or editing—students move fluidly among them.


Peer Ecosystems: Honest, constructive peer feedback is enabled by structured bubbles and optional anonymity.


AI-as-Guide (Not Ghostwriter): AI never writes for the student. Instead, it prompts, questions, and evolves as the user grows in mastery.
